<hr />

Everyone should learn to tell the difference between good and bad, and between easy and difficult.</br>
每个人都应该学会分辨好与坏、易与难。</br>
<br/>
It is ridiculous, that capability, pressure, hard working, and luckiness are sometimes misunderstood as the same thing by most people.</br>
非常可笑，能力、压力、努力、幸运，有的时候大家竟然会误以为是同一种东西。</br>
<br/>
I dislike, and sometimes look down upon, those full of (random) ideas, but fail to appreciate the difficulties behind real implementations.</br>
我不喜欢，有时甚至是瞧不起，那些总是有很多想法，但却不懂得欣赏工程实现背后的复杂性的人。</br>
<br/>
By "design and implement", I mean, to think, to plan, to arrange, to actually write code, to test, and to debug.</br>
当我说“设计并实现”的时候，我指的是想，计划，编排，并且真实的写代码，测试，调试
